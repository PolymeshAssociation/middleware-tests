/*
  Instructions are the primary way to move Assets on Polymesh. Some points to know:

  - An instruction is composed of multiple legs, each leg represents an Asset movement.
  - The execution of the Instruction is atomic - either all legs are executed or none are
  - Every Identity referenced in any leg must affirm before the Instruction can be executed
  - Every Identity must comply with any transfer and compliance restrictions on the Asset
  - Every Instruction is associated with a Venue, allowing for an optional 3rd party to mediate

  This script showcases Settlement related functionality. It:
    - Creates a Venue
    - Fetches a Venue's details
    - Fetches all of the signing Identity's Venues
    - Adds an Instruction to a Venue
    - Fetches all of the signing Identity's Pending Instructions
    - Affirm//Reject an Instruction
